# Real-Time Object Detection for Autonomous Vehicles

This project focuses on building a machine learning model that can detect and classify objects in the environment, such as pedestrians, vehicles, traffic signs, and obstacles. The model will be deployed in autonomous vehicle systems to enhance safety and decision making in real-time driving scenarios.

## Datasets

*   KITTI
*   nuScenes
*   Open Images

## Key Focus Areas

1.  Real-Time Detection: Ensuring that the system can accurately detect and classify objects in real time, necessary for autonomous vehicle operation.
2.  Transfer Learning: Leveraging pre-trained models (e.g., COCO) for fast adaptation and better performance.
3.  Environmental Adaptation: Developing a robust system capable of performing well across different driving environments (urban, highways, night, and adverse weather).
4.  Continuous Monitoring: Using MLOps tools to track model performance, detect drifts, and retrain the system as new data becomes available.
5.  Safety and Reliability: Ensuring the system operates in a fail-safe manner with robust object detection to ensure the safety of passengers and pedestrians.
